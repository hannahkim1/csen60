# UX/UI Design Lecture

## Notes
- usability is how effectively someone can navigate an interface or find information online
- design changes, usability is forever
- ui/ux is involved a lot within marketing (a lot of crossover)

#### many problems
- too many ads
- too much text (no one wants to read)

#### design principles
- include a search bar if more than one page
- nav bar should be consistent
- Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience, test your design with real users
- 3 click rule - don't want to be more than three clicks away
- website should accomodate all user's screen size and all browsers

#### seo
- having good accessibility and semantic html encourages your website to show up at the top

## Exercise
- not a strong enough contrast between the background color and text
- link images are too small and the same
- no specific sections, navigating could be a bit confusing
- logo is same size as the search, everything is relatively the same size
- no distinct header and no distinct footer
- no nav bar in the home page
- bright yellow coloring is not accessible

- when you search, images are all different sizes and messy
- nav bar is too small and blended in
